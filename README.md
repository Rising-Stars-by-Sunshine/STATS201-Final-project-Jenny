- **Project Summary**:
  - **Summarize the Background/Motivation**

  In recent years, climate change has been a focal point of intense debate, sparking widespread discussions on various platforms, particularly on the internet. This heightened discourse is mirrored by the escalating pace of climate change and the frequent occurrences of natural disasters. As society grapples with the increasing impact of climate-related incidents, public perceptions and discussions on climate change have undergone notable shifts. This research aims to navigate this evolving landscape by closely examining Twitter discussions during a crucial period in 2022. The focus is on capturing the changing dynamics and correlations between public sentiments and climatic events, contributing to a deeper understanding of the ongoing discourse surrounding climate change.
  - **Research Questions**
  
    1. **What are the most prevalent topics in climate change discussions on Twitter, and how do the dynamic shifts over time reflect  public perception towards climate change during the first half of 2022?**
    2. **What is the correlation between the frequency of tweets and the occurrence of natural disasters during the first half of 2022?**
    3. **How do different user stances contribute to climate change discussions on Twitter?**

  - **Application Scenario (Data Source)**
  
  The research relies on a Kaggle-sourced dataset, covering daily Twitter discussions on 'Climate Change' from January 1, 2022, to July 19, 2022. This dataset, chosen during a year marked by unprecedented global extreme weather events, offers a unique insight into public sentiment during impactful climatic occurrences. Leveraging machine learning, specifically OpenAI's GPT-3.5 for sentiment analysis and BERTopic for topic modeling, the study aims to explore the correlation between climate discourse, extreme weather events, and environmental policy releases. The extensive timeframe allows for iterative exploration, providing refined insights into the evolving dynamics of public perception concerning climate change on Twitter amid the climate crisis.
  
  - **Methodology**

  The methodology is designed to address three research questions, focusing on prevalent topics, the correlation between tweet frequency and natural disasters, and the impact of different user stances on climate change discussions on Twitter. The significance lies in providing insights for policymakers, researchers, and the public regarding the intricate relationship between real-world events, environmental policies, and social media discourse.

  Operational measures include defining variables (dependent: tweet frequency, independent: extreme weather events, environmental policy), with time-series data collected from top daily tweets with the 'Climate Change' hashtag in the first half of 2022. The hypothesis anticipates a positive correlation based on recent findings. Machine learning involves GPT-3.5 for sentiment analysis, BERTopic for topic modeling, and linear regression for analyzing relationships.

  The workflow includes dataset collection, tweet classification, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and linear regression. Results presentation involves cross-validation, data visualization of clusters and trends, comparative analysis with representative accounts, and model evaluation using precision and F1 score. Iterative improvement strategies include feedback and bias mitigation for GPT-3.5 and cross-validation for BERTopic. This concise methodology aims to comprehensively explore climate change discussions on Twitter.

- **Self-introduction**

  Hi I'm Jenny Zheng from Duke Kunshan University, Class of 2026.

  **Intended major:** Computation and Design with Social Policy track
  
  **Research projects focus:** quantitative social science and environmental science; analyzing public perceptions on societal problems.
  
  Besides, I am also interested in consulting and finance, where I'd like to apply my skills to business-world practice.
  
  **Other experiences**:
  - Bain & Company, Part-time assistant
    - PE fund, FMCG, Manufacturing
    - Strategy, Due diligence
  - GoodWe, Investment intern
    - industry research on renewable energy
  - Duke Kunshan University, Peer tutor
    - STATS101, Applied statistical methods

- **Final reflections**
  - **Intellectual Growth:**

    Through Class: Gaining proficiency in machine learning has afforded me a more profound comprehension of its contemporary applications. In the realm of social science, employing machine learning and diverse packages to address societal issues has empowered me to explore and resolve these topics more thoroughly. Moreover, the classroom setting facilitated a better grasp of machine learning applications, as students could conduct research aligned with their individual interests. Consequently, the class structure and environment significantly facilitated my in-depth exploration of the practical applications of machine learning.

  - **Interdisciplinary Growth:**
  
    In taking this course and hearing everyone's research directions, I was able to observe how interdisciplinary collaboration truly unfolds in research. Specifically, as a computation and design major, most of my research stems from design thinking. However, adding a research topic concerning the global health and linguistic perspective of the impact and features of language impairment allowed me to further broaden my knowledge. Furthermore, witnessing the different approaches that students from various majors take in conducting this research was intriguing. For instance, computer science students may focus more on the coding and efficiency aspects, while I, with a design thinking perspective, consider the potential impact of such research in the context of design. It was interesting to see the diversity of approaches.
Professional growth: Gaining a general understanding of machine learning has significantly contributed to my professional growth, enabling me to engage in discussions with a diverse range of designers and artists. Particularly, in light of the prevailing trend where many designers utilize machine learning as a tool to enhance their work, I view my decision to advance my professional growth in this direction as a meaningful step forward.

  - **Living a purposeful life:**

    In the future, I aspire to be acknowledged as a designer characterized by a commitment to care. Given that many of my projects center around improving the learning process and addressing global issues, I aim to be recognized within the design community as a leading advocate for compassionate design. Thus, my feature sentence would potentially be "advocate for compassionate design within the design community". I would like my future contributions to the world to involve encouraging more designers to create things based on care and support for the world.
