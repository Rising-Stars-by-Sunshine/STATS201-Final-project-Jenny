In dissecting the dynamic shifts in prevalent topics over time, a nuanced understanding emerges regarding how these shifts reflect public perception towards climate change during the first half of 2022. The diverse array of topics identified, ranging from regional political considerations such as Australia and Trudeau to global concerns like climate change and emissions, serves as a microcosm of the multifaceted nature of public discourse on Twitter.

The temporal evolution of these topics provides a lens through which we can observe the ebb and flow of public sentiment in response to real-world events and developments. Notably, the occurrence of spikes in discussions related to specific topics aligns with significant climate events, policy announcements, or other influential occurrences. These temporal patterns offer a nuanced portrayal of how public perception adapts and responds to the unfolding narrative around climate change throughout the specified period.

In essence, the dynamic shifts witnessed in the prevalent topics on Twitter serve as a dynamic reflection of the broader societal context. The identified topics, representing a spectrum from local to global issues, collectively illustrate the diverse perspectives through which the public engages with climate change. This research contributes to a comprehensive portrayal of the interconnectedness between these topics and the evolving landscape of public perception towards climate change during the first half of 2022 in the digital realm.


### What is the correlation between the frequency of tweets and the occurrence of natural disasters during the first half of 2022?

The escalating pace of climate change and the frequent occurrences of natural disasters have propelled climate-related discussions, particularly on online platforms such as Twitter. This surge in discourse reflects the societal response to the increasing impact of climate-related incidents and underscores the evolving nature of public perceptions on climate change. Analyzing the Twitter data reveals that discussions related to Australia dominated the platform, especially from March to June 2022 (CDP 2022).

In light of the prominence of the Australia-related topic, the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the frequency of tweets and the occurrence of natural disasters during the first half of 2022 gains significance. For instance, Topic0, centered around Australia, witnessed a notable presence in the dataset. Approximately 0.5% of tweets mentioned Australia, with over half originating from Australian institutes or academia, discussing climate change. This aligns with the reality that during this period, 70% of Australians experienced natural disasters, including flooding and storms (“70 Percent of Australians Impacted by Natural Disasters - KPMG Australia” 2023), resulting in substantial financial costs and prompting governmental actions for disaster recovery (Jackson 2023).

The correlation between tweet frequency and natural disasters is evident in the substantial online discussion sparked by these events. News reports on the natural disasters, discussions about post-disaster recovery, and calls for government action contributed to the heightened engagement on Twitter. Thus, the data supports the hypothesis, indicating a notable correlation between the frequency of tweets and the occurrence of natural disasters during the first half of 2022.

### How do different user stances contribute to climate change discussions on Twitter?

The climate change discussion on Twitter reflects varied viewpoints, as 47% of users maintain neutrality, 28% hold skepticism, and 25% advocate for climate change. This dynamic signifies an ongoing debate, emphasizing the importance of efforts to climate change education and advocacy to effectively mold public opinion.
